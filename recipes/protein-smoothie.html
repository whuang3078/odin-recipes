        <h3>Description</h3>
        <p>
            This served as one of my staple cutting meals for 
            whenever I've gotten ready for photoshoots or just plain <em>shredded</em>.
        </p>
        <p>
            Incredibly filling, cheap, delicious, and most importantly, <em>easy</em>
            as boiling pasta to prepare (though much faster to ready), it's quite
            obvious why I loved this meal.
        </p>
